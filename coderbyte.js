/*
Take the array of strings stored in strArr, which will contain only two strings,
the first parameter being the string N and the second parameter being a string K
of some characters,
and your goal is to determine the smallest substring of N that contains all the
characters in K.

For example: if strArr is ["aaabaaddae", "aed"]
then the smallest substring of N that contains the characters a, e, and d is "dae"
located at the end of the string.
